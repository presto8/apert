Apert is an open-source router project based on NixOS.

The name apert is inspired by the aperture of a camera that opens and closes to
control the amount of light into the camera. Similarly, apert opens and closes
to control the amount of data that enters the home network. The name is also
inspired by Neil Stephenson's book "Anathem", in which a giant door opens
periodically during a ceremony called apert to control the spread of
information.

# Motivation

<img src="assets/bilbo.jpg" alt="Why shouldn't I have my own router?" align="right" style="width: 200px;" />

I saw this great presentation [Michael Stapelberg: Why I wrote my own
rsync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpwObdgemoE) and it included a section
on his project, router7. It occurred to me that rather than trying to modify my
Ubiquiti EdgeRouter-X to do everything I want, it might be easier to just write
everything myself. And it would be a lot of fun and I would learn a lot. And
thus, apert was born.
