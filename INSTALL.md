# Apert Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up your own Apert installation.

## Hardware Requirements

* PC supported by NixOS
* Two physical Ethernet ports (can be USB)

## Install NixOS

Begin by installing NixOS on the system.

The easiest method is to use the graphical NixOS installer. Download the
Graphical ISO image from the [NixOS download
page](https://nixos.org/download.html).

Most of the configuration will be replaced later in the guide, so just accept
all the defaults.

Advanced users or users wanting more control can follow the [NixOS installation
guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-installation).

Once the system is installed and booting, proceed to the next step.
